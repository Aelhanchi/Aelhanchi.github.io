I am a master's student in Mathematics and Statistics at
[McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/),
supervised by [David Stephens](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/dstephens/).
I completed my bachelor's degree in
[Honours Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.mcgill.ca/mathstat/undergraduate/programs/b-sc/joint-honours-mathematics-and-computer-science-b-sc).


My research interests lie at the intersection of theory and algorithms
for machine learning and statistics, with a focus on large-scale
gradient-based optimization and sampling.


More generally, I am interested in developing the computational
and statistical tools for building systems that can make optimal
decisions under uncertainty.
